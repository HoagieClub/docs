# Setup

The setup process will slightly differ depending on your operating system.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MacOS">
    The easiest way to install the required dependencies is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

    ## Step 1. Install Homebrew

    Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash zsh
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

    We'll use Homebrew to install:
    - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), our database.
    - [Bun](https://bun.sh/), our TypeScript package manager.
    - [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), our Python package manager.

    For more information on our tech stack, please visit our [tech stack page](/tech-stack).

    ----

    ## Step 2. Install required packages

    PostgreSQL:
    ```bash zsh
    brew install postgresql@17 # Latest version
    ```

    Bun:
    ```bash zsh
    brew install oven-sh/bun/bun
    ```

    uv:
    ```bash zsh
    brew install uv
    ```

    ----

    ## Step 3. Clone the Hoagie Plan repository

    We use [GitHub](https://github.com/hoagieclub/) for version control.

    ```bash zsh
    git clone https://github.com/hoagieclub/plan.git
    ```

    <Info>
    **NOTE:** Environment variables are <b>not</b> included in cloned repositories.
    </Info>

    ----

    ## Step 4. Environment variables

    After you have the repository on your local device, you'll need to add the environment variables.

    #### Frontend
    In the `frontend/` directory, create a hidden file named `.env.local`.

    #### Backend
    In the `backend/` directory, create a hidden file named `.env`.

    #### Values
    See the Slack for the values for these environment variables. Once you have access to the files, paste them in as is.

    There are template files for the frontend and the backend -- `.env.local.example` and `.env.example`, respectively -- so that you know which values the app is expecting.

    ----

    ## Step 5. Downloading dependencies

    You will need to download the required dependencies before you can run the app.

    #### Frontend

    In the base directory of the project, `cd` into the `frontend/` directory and run the following command:

    ```bash zsh
    bun install
    ```

    This installs the frontend dependencies as specified in `package.json` to ensure consistent package versions across environments.

    #### Backend

    In the base directory of the project, `cd` into the `backend/` directory.

    Then, create a **virtual environment** using the following command:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash uv
    uv venv --prompt hoagie-plan .venv
    ```

    ```bash python3
    python3 -m venv --prompt hoagie-plan .venv
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    This creates a virtual environment named `hoagie-plan` contained within the `.venv` directory.
    Activate this virtual environment with the following command:

    ```bash venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Then, install the backend dependencies with the following command:
    ```bash zsh
    uv sync
    ```

    This installs the required Python packages as specified in `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, and `uv.lock` to ensure consistent package versions across environments.

    ----

    ## Step 6. Running the app

    You will need to run the frontend and backend applications **simultaneously.**

    #### Frontend
    In the base directory of the project, `cd` into the `frontend/` directory:
    ```bash zsh
    cd frontend
    ```

    Then, run the following command:
    ```bash zsh
    bun run dev
    ```

    #### Backend
    In the base directory of the project, `cd` into the `backend/` directory:
    ```bash zsh
    cd backend
    ```

    Then, run the following command:
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash uv
    uv run manage.py runserver
    ```

    ```bash python3
    python3 manage.py runserver
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    You're all set! Happy coding.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Windows">
    It is a bit of a nightmare to get the Windows environment set up.

    We've found the fastest workaround to be installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). For more details, see this [article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

    ## Step 1. Open PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt
    You must do this in **administrator mode** by right-clicking and selecting "Run as administrator".

    ----

    ## Step 2. Installing WSL
    Run the following command:
    ```powershell powershell
    wsl --install
    ```

    ----

    ## Step 3. Open Ubuntu
    Open the **Start Menu**, search for **Ubuntu** (or the name of the Linux distribution you installed), and click on the app to open it.

    When you launch Ubuntu for the first time, it will take a few minutes to set up, and you may be prompted to create a new username and password for your Linux environment.

    ## Step 4. Install Homebrew

    From here, the steps should be identical to the MacOS guide above.

    The easiest way to install the required dependencies is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

    Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

    We'll use Homebrew to install:
    - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), our database.
    - [Bun](https://bun.sh/), our TypeScript package manager.
    - [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), our Python package manager.

    ## Step 5. Install required packages

    PostgreSQL:
    ```bash bash
    brew install postgresql@17 # Latest version
    ```

    Bun:
    ```bash bash
    brew install oven-sh/bun/bun
    ```

    uv:
    ```bash bash
    brew install uv
    ```

    ----

    ## Step 6. Clone the Hoagie Plan repository

    We use [GitHub](https://github.com/hoagieclub/) for version control.

    ```bash bash
    git clone https://github.com/hoagieclub/plan.git
    ```

    <Info>
    **NOTE:** Environment variables are <b>not</b> included in cloned repositories.
    </Info>

    ----

    ## Step 7. Environment variables

    After you have the repository on your local device, you'll need to add the environment variables.

    #### Frontend
    In the `frontend/` directory, create a hidden file named `.env.local`.

    #### Backend
    In the `backend/` directory, create a hidden file named `.env`.

    #### Values
    See the Slack for the values for these environment variables. Once you have access to the files, paste them in as is.

    There are template files for the frontend and the backend -- `.env.local.example` and `.env.example`, respectively -- so that you know which values the app is expecting.

    ----

    ## Step 8. Downloading dependencies

    You will need to download the required dependencies before you can run the app.

    #### Frontend

    In the base directory of the project, `cd` into the `frontend/` directory and run the following command:

    ```bash bash
    bun install
    ```

    This installs the frontend dependencies as specified in `package.json` to ensure consistent package versions across environments.

    #### Backend

    In the base directory of the project, `cd` into the `backend/` directory.

    Then, create a **virtual environment** using the following command:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash uv
    uv venv --prompt hoagie-plan .venv
    ```

    ```bash python3
    python3 -m venv --prompt hoagie-plan .venv
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    This creates a virtual environment named `hoagie-plan` contained within the `.venv` directory.
    Activate this virtual environment with the following command:

    ```bash venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Then, install the backend dependencies with the following command:
    ```bash bash
    uv sync
    ```

    This installs the required Python packages as specified in `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, and `uv.lock` to ensure consistent package versions across environments.

    ----

    ## Step 9. Running the app

    You will need to run the frontend and backend applications **simultaneously.**

    #### Frontend
    In the base directory of the project, `cd` into the `frontend/` directory:
    ```bash bash
    cd frontend
    ```

    Then, run the following command:
    ```bash bash
    bun run dev
    ```

    #### Backend
    In the base directory of the project, `cd` into the `backend/` directory:
    ```bash bash
    cd backend
    ```

    Then, run the following command:
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash uv
    uv run manage.py runserver
    ```

    ```bash python3
    python3 manage.py runserver
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter when setting up your development environment.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scary-looking `psycopg2` error">
    Ensure that you have `PostgreSQL` installed on your system using Homebrew. You can install it by running:
    ```bash
    brew install postgresql
    ```
    After installation, verify that the PostgreSQL path is added to your `PATH` environment variable to avoid issues. You can check this by running:
    ```bash
    echo $PATH
    ```
    If the path is missing, you can add PostgreSQL to your path by appending it directly to your shell configuration file (like `.zshrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.bashrc`). For example:
    ```bash zsh
    echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/postgresql/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
    ```
    Remember to source the file afterward to apply the changes immediately:
    ```bash zsh
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```
