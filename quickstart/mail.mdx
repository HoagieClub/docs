# Setup

If you have a Windows operating system, complete these steps before continuing.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Windows">
    It is a bit of a nightmare to get the Windows environment set up.

    We've found the fastest workaround to be installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). For more details, see this [article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

    ## Step 1: Open PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt
    You must do this in **administrator mode** by right-clicking and selecting "Run as administrator".

    ----

    ## Step 2: Installing WSL
    Run the following command:
    ```powershell powershell
    wsl --install
    ```

    ----

    ## Step 3: Open Ubuntu
    Open the **Start Menu**, search for **Ubuntu** (or the name of the Linux distribution you installed), and click on the app to open it.

    When you launch Ubuntu for the first time, it will take a few minutes to set up, and you may be prompted to create a new username and password for your Linux environment.

 ## Step 1: Install Homebrew

    The easiest way to install the required dependencies is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

    ----

    ## Step 2: Install required tools

    [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/), our package manager:
    ```bash bash
    brew install yarn
    ```

    We use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development. Download it and get the following extensions:
    - [Eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
    - [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
    - [Go](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go)

    ---

    ## Step 3: Clone the repositories.

    We use [GitHub](https://github.com/hoagieclub/) for version control. You will need to have GitHub Personal Access Tokens set up.

    <Accordion title="Set Up Personal Access Token">
    1. Run `git config --global credential.helper store`
    2. Create a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) - either fine-grained or classic is fine
    3. Next time you run a git command in terminal it will [ask for credentials](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#using-a-personal-access-token-on-the-command-line)
    </Accordion>



    ```bash bash
    git clone https://github.com/HoagieClub/mail.git
    git clone https://github.com/HoagieClub/api.git
    git clone https://github.com/HoagieClub/stuff.git
    ```

    <Info>
    **NOTE:** Environment variables are <b>not</b> included in cloned repositories.
    </Info>

    ---

    ## Step 4: Environment variables

    After you have the repository on your local device, you'll need to add the environment variables.

    Switch into the preview branch:
    ```bash bash
    git switch preview
    ```

    For all three repositories, rename the `.env.local.txt` file to `.env.local`. For mail and stuff, copy over the environment variables from Slack. 

    ---
    
    ## Step 5: Download dependencies

    You will need to download the required dependencies before you can run the apps.

    From the api repository, run:
    ```bash bash
    go get
    ```

    From the mail and stuff repositories, run:
    ```bash bash
    yarn
    ```

    ---

    ## Step 6: Run the apps

    You will need to run the frontend and backend simultaneously.

    ### Backend
    The backend is written in Go. Run `main.go` from the api repository.

    ```bash bash
    go run main.go reset
    ```

    It might take a second to start up. Once it displays `[i] Running on https://localhost:8080`, you're all set.

    ### Frontend
    From either the stuff or mail repository, run:

    ```bash bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    Open the localhost link in your browser.
